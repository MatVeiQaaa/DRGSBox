# DRGSBox

Injected .dll with a few features for Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. Doesn't really do a lot, as it's meant for me to learn approaching Unity games and build some framework for it. Relies on IL2CPP to get anything done, for which it has bindings to the functions exported by GameAssembly.dll.

Upon injection into the game process by any convenient means, the ImGui menu with available features can be brought up by pressing 'Insert' button.
